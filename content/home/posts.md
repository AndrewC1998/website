description = """Alongside my studies at Lancaster, I was also a Mathematics Ambassador. As a Mathematics ambassador it was my job to conduct campus tours, work on behalf of my department and represent the university on Open Days. For the Open Days, I showed potential and current applicants around the university accommodation and gave them any information that they required.
As a Mathematics ambassador, I also presented lectures and talked about student life at Lancaster, what it is like to study Maths and answered any subject specific questions the applicants had."""
