My research topic is wavelet methods applied to point processes. I have undertaken research into the underlying structure of Hawkes processes, a special case of self-exciting point processes, and their behaviour in the context of local stationarity. My research has extended [developed] my Masterâ€™s work to discuss other identifiability constraints of Hawkes processes as well as extending to [encompassing] more complex cases of the Hawkes process such as time-varying kernels and time-varying non-linear background intensity functions. This work utilises locally stationary wavelets and the methods have been applied to natural phenomena data sets."""
