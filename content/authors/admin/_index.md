Graduate Mathematician and Statistician with a specialism in computational statistics, wavelet methods and stochastic processes.

After completing an MSc in Statistics (Theory and Methods) at Imperial College London, I am currently undertaking a PhD in Statistics under the supervision of [Professor Emma McCoy](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/e.mccoy) and [Dr. Ed Cohen](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/e.cohen) researching the application of wavelets to Point Processes.

I completed my Masters thesis on identifiability of self-exciting point processes, and continued to extend this work during my PhD.

Furthermore, I was a Google Summer of Code open source developer working on creating and maintaining a package for R Project for Statistical Computing. This package is called changepoint.online, and alongside developing the package, I also developed new statistical methods. My research involved the creation of new changepoint detection methods which are online versions of the statistical methods PELT and ECP. I have continued to develop changepoint methods and additionally develop wavelet methods.
