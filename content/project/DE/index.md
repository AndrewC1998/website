Project Amity aims to combat loneliness amongst the local elderly population by reaching out to people who may suffer from loneliness, and encouraging them to visit local organisations in order build strong friendships to prevent feelings of loneliness. Currently the group are involved in growing vegetables, knitting blankets for the premature baby ward and dance classes. Amity is an opportunity for all Enactus Lancaster students along with other volunteers to give back to our community while also helping to develop resources for the other projects. These resources help reduce the costs of running the other projects meaning a greater profit margin and enabling us to run more free classes.

Amity has continued to create a sense of community with our project partner, The Friendship Centre, through our weekly knitting class, Knit ‘n’ Knatter. The class began in December 2016, with only one lady attending, Pam. Fast forward to the present day, over 2 years later and Pam is still in attendance each week, along with 23 other members! Here are two members talking about how the Friendship Centre has affected their lives.

In order to gain access to those who are more difficult to reach, we are working with the local council to set up an initiative where our project members can go door-to-door.  This will allow us to talk directly to those we are unable to reach through our public advertising. During our time at ‘Knit n Knatter’, we have realised that a simple chat can brighten the day of the loneliest individual. Going door-to-door helps to bring this service to people who are not comfortable leaving their own homes, improving their confidence and easing them into the idea of social interaction. Additionally, through our contacts with the Lancaster Infirmary, we are hoping to spread the message of the Friendship Centre through healthcare workers who often visit the homes of elderly individuals. These two initiatives will also allow us to bring awareness to the Friendship Centre, widening the social network we have helped to create.  Given that joining a regular class can be daunting, we will organise coffee mornings to bridge the gap between new and existing beneficiaries, whilst providing a sustainable income to further grow our project. 

In November 2018, we won £250 funding through the Tesco Mental Health ITC. We are planning to use this money to further advertise the Friendship Centre to support our initiatives. Through our development questionnaires, we are able to identify the growth of our beneficiaries, assessing how their contacts at the Friendship Centre have impacted their social lives and if they feel like a more active member of the community. We have direct contact with each one of our beneficiaries at ‘Knit n Knatter’, allowing us to fully understand the impact we are having and how we can help further.  Through our attendance registers, we have identified 11 ladies regularly attend, 13 attend occasionally and therefore, we have directly impacted 24 lifes. That is 24 ladies who now feel more confident and have friends they can turn to in a time of need. As well as direct impact, hundreds of families have been impacted through the thousands of knitted goods donated to the Premature Baby Unit by the ladies at ‘Knit n Knatter’. The change in their own social lives has empowered them to give support to young families who have been through trauma.
