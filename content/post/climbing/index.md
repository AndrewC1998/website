Andrew has been an active and dedicated member of the Imperial College Mountaineering Club (ICMC), where he has played a vital role in both the club’s operations and the wider London climbing community. His passion for climbing extends across multiple disciplines, from bouldering to sport climbing, lead climbing, and traditional (trad) climbing. This breadth of experience has not only allowed him to develop a deep personal love for the sport but also to contribute to the climbing community around him.

As a part of ICMC, Andrew has taken on numerous responsibilities. He regularly drives fellow members on trips, ensuring they can safely and efficiently reach climbing destinations. Additionally, he has assisted in managing the club’s climbing gear, from tidying and organising the climbing store to ordering and collecting new equipment.
