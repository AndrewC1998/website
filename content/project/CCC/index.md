# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "We find high-potential entrepreneurs in South African townships who severely lack world view and global thinking. Their innovation power suffers from their limited horizon while we have many highly skilled people in Europe who lack the local insight. To address the demand for entrepreneurial skills in South Africa, we piloted CCC in 2018, an online platform accessible to everyone in South Africa, where we provide a project management tool for development and management of business ideas."
