Difference Enabled worked one on one with local autistic individuals to develop social, personal, and employability skills. To better support the individuals, Difference Enabled worked with a small business "Zest" which prepared and sold salads for individuals to practise their skills and gain work experience. The ingredients were all from those grown by Green Lancaster as well as the volunteers from Amity.

Though the stall was an excellent idea, it was realised that it would only ever have an impact on a very limited number of beneficiaries. While the stall was run, the team looked elsewhere to expand.

Difference enabled eventually expanded out into a second project: Girls Get Diagnosed. This project focuses on designing an online forum to improve the diagnosis of autism among girls who are four times less likely to be diagnosed otherwise.
