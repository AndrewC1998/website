Project Amity aims to combat loneliness amongst the local elderly population by reaching out to people who may suffer from loneliness, and encouraging them to visit local organisations in order build strong friendships to prevent feelings of loneliness. Currently the group are involved in growing vegetables, knitting blankets for the premature baby ward and dance classes. Amity is an opportunity for all Enactus Lancaster students along with other volunteers to give back to our community while also helping to develop resources for the other projects. These resources help reduce the costs of running the other projects meaning a greater profit margin and enabling us to run more free classes.

Amity has continued to create a sense of community with our project partner, The Friendship Centre, through our weekly knitting class, Knit ‘n’ Knatter. The class began in December 2016, with only one lady attending, Pam. Over 2 years later Pam was still in attendance each week, along with 23 other members!

In order to gain access to those who are more difficult to reach, the group was working with the local council to set up an initiative where our project members can go door-to-door. This allows the group to talk directly to those who are unable to reach through public advertising. During the time at ‘Knit n Knatter’, we have realised that a simple chat can brighten the day of the loneliest individual. Going door-to-door helps to bring this service to people who are not comfortable leaving their own homes, improving their confidence and easing them into the idea of social interaction. These initiatives will also bring awareness to the Friendship Centre, widening the social network that has been created.

In November 2018, the group won £250 funding through the Tesco Mental Health ITC. This money was used to further advertise the Friendship Centre to support these initiatives. Through the development questionnaires, the group was able to identify the growth of the beneficiaries, assessing how their contacts at the Friendship Centre have impacted their social lives and if they feel like a more active member of the community. As well as direct impact, hundreds of families have been impacted through the thousands of knitted goods donated to the Premature Baby Unit by the ladies at ‘Knit n Knatter’. The change in their own social lives has empowered them to give support to young families who have been through trauma. 

This project has also been further expanded into Silver Years which aims to give the same elderly group access to technology so as to enrich their lives in return and further connect them with their owned loved ones and the broader community.
