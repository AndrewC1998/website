My journey into stand-up comedy began as an extension of a lifelong passion for performance, rooted in the acting classes I took as a child, where I earned a Gold LAMDA Award with Distinction. Over the year and a half I participated, I’ve performed at a variety of venues across London, honing my ability to connect with diverse audiences through humour and storytelling.

Stand-up comedy has not only sharpened my quick thinking and adaptability but also reinforced my skills in communication, audience engagement, and creative problem-solving—qualities that are invaluable in any professional setting. My experience on stage reflects a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the confidence to face challenges head-on, making me well-equipped to bring a fresh perspective and dynamic energy to any role.
