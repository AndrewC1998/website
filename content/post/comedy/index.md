My journey into stand-up comedy began as an extension of a lifelong passion for performance, rooted in the acting classes I took as a child, where I achieved a Gold LAMDA Award with Distinction.

Over the past year and a half, I have performed at various venues across London, honing my ability to connect with diverse audiences through humour and storytelling. This experience has sharpened my quick thinking, adaptability, and reinforced my skills in communication, audience engagement, and creative problem-solving—qualities that are invaluable in any professional setting.

In addition to my stand-up work, I co-hosted a weekly radio show, “The Atomic Fridge,” on Bailrigg FM alongside two fellow students. Our show, broadcast on Thursday mornings, featured interviews with esteemed guests such as [Professor Alexander Belton](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/alexander-belton), [Professor Roger Jones](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/roger-william-lewis-jones) and [Dr. Mark MacDonald](https://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~macdonam/). We delved into topics concerning mathematics, physics and statistical research, aiming to broaden our listeners’ knowledge. This experience not only deepened my understanding of these fields but also enhanced my ability to convey complex ideas in an accessible and engaging manner. My time on stage and on the air reflects a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the confidence to face challenges head-on, making me well-equipped to bring a fresh perspective and dynamic energy to any role.
