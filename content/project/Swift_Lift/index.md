Parking on university campuses, such as Lancaster University, can often be a difficult task due to limited space and high fees. Pairing this with the high price of bus passes, travelling to and from campus can be impractical. Enactus Lancaster decided to act and create a solution that benefits staff, students and the university as a whole.

Swift Lift is a campus-wide car-sharing application that connects drivers with commuters, helping them get to and from campus in a cheap and safe manner. The app uses the live locations of commuters and drivers to determine the most efficient pick-up for both parties. 

As well as providing a useful service, Swift Lift also helps to reduce the carbon footprint of the university. Our calculations suggest that if one third of cars parking on the campus each day stayed home then Lancaster University could move up by one spot on the UK university environment rankings. 

We are beginning with Lancaster University, with a long-term plan to be implemented in many universities across the United Kingdom. Our 12 month-plan is to finish developing the app, have it ready for use and be fully integrated into the university’s existing app for staff and students. Over the next 2 years, we hope to establish a steady stream of drivers and commuters at Lancaster University and begin reaching out to other universities to introduce Swift Lift on their campuses.

Swift Lift has a target market with two components, drivers and commuters.
Our target market for commuters is primarily students at Lancaster University - this is a market size of approximately 13,000 students. Additionally, we plan to target the 2,500 members of staff who work on the campus. Lancaster University used to have a staff-only car-sharing system with other 70 active users, however it has since been shut down. This shows that staff are interested in car-sharing to and from the campus, reinforcing our assumption that there is demand for a service such as Swift Lift.

Alternatively, our target market for drivers is anyone, staff or student, who drives to and from campus. Out of these drivers, we aim to target those who drive alone. The university’s 2015 Travel Survey found that 43% of staff members at the university travelled by car alone, compared to only 13% who car-shared. Similarly, 11.5% of students commuted to campus as sole occupants in cars and 4.8% used car-sharing. Our goal is to convert some of these sole-occupants into Swift Lift drivers.

In order to encourage drivers, we have come up with driver incentives. Currently in order to effectively implement this car-sharing system, we have partnered with Green Lancaster, the university’s environmental initiative team, and Digital Lancaster, the university’s technology management team. 

Currently, staff and students with parking permits have to pay between £3 and £5 every single day, and this is without the guarantee of even finding a parking space - this is because the car parks are over capacity due to the increasing number of parking permits being given each year. Green Lancaster has kindly agreed to provide our Swift Lift drivers with a free parking permit, so long as they meet our monthly requirement for number of car-shares.

Additionally, in order for staff and students to trust that our app is safe and credible, we reached out to Digital Lancaster who have agreed to integrate our app into the existing iLancaster app. This will make users feel more safe and also increase our exposure since the app is used by almost every single student.

As well as the daily commuting aspect of our Swift Lift system, we also plan to implement a long-distance transport system where students living in similar areas can travel home together during the holidays. Imagine a transport system where you can get from Lancaster to London for under £30, a trip made by hundreds of students every term ending and term beginning. The average student cost for fuel ranges from 10 to 13 pence per mile, making driving the most cost-effective solution for short and long distance trips.
Each student who drives home alone already does this, but has to pay the entire bill themselves. Under this scheme, we could charge a small fee so that the drivers can find people to commute with and share the cost, making the trip cheaper per person.

We will charge every student at the university a termly fee of 30 pence to use the service, and provide an opt-out to anyone who doesn’t want to use the system. The cost of being a part of this service each term is negligible when compared to the cost of a bus pass. Lancaster University has around 13,000 students, which would give an approximate revenue of £3,900 each term.

If we were to include other universities in this scheme, say three in the northwest region, we would allow them to charge their own price, and take another 30p for each student on their scheme. This would allow us to gain another £3,900 each term if we were to assume the university is of a similar size to ourselves. In fact, average university size in the UK is 25,000 people so Lancaster is considered small and so these are relatively reserved calculations.

We will charge each student who signs up for the long distance car-share an additional fee of 30p, and allow them to share the costs for fuel between those who participate.

We have predicted that under our current financial model, we will be looking at revenue of around £4000 a term in the first year. By the end of the third year, we are estimating a gross revenue of £12,700 a term. Though this is revenue in both cases, our overheards are minimal and so these figures will be close to our gross profit. Because of the way in which we’re implementing the system, the university will break even, it will look better on the university rankings, and we will develop a strong profit to continue the development of this project.

If your company or university would be interested in implementing this scheme please contact us at enactus@lancaster.ac.uk .
